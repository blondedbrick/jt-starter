# Jekyll/Tailwind Starter

Jekyll with tailwind built in. This also has material icons linked so theres that. I still have to setup the proper github actions for this to work with github pages, which is the end goal. You may use this template however you like, im not very good with coding so i would appreciate any suggestions on how to improve this starter template.

## Installing prerequisites

Once you've cloned and opened this in VS Code, open your terminal and the following commands in order:

`bundler install`
`npm install`
`bundle exec jekyll build`
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Afterwards open a second terminal and input the following commands, also in order:

`npm run build:css`
`npm run watch:css`
