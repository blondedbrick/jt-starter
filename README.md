# Jekyll/Tailwind Starter

Jekyll with tailwind built in, you might have to add the node modules i havent figured out stuff yet. This also has material icons linked so theres that. I still have to setup the proper github actions for this to work with github pages, which is the end goal.

## Installing prerequisites

Once you've cloned and opened this in VS Code, open your terminal and the following commands in order:

`bundler install`
`npm install`
` bundle exec jekyll build`
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Afterwards open a second terminal and input the following commands, also in order:

`npm run build:css`
`npm run watch:css`
